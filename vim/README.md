It's been lot of time I use vim. Probably as long as I use
Linux and shell as my development environment. I've used it
to code in anything from x86 assembly to Java and C#.
Firest I've enjoyed amazing flexibility for providing actions
you really need. Instead of stiff graphical user iterface you
get total freedom in programming your environment. For shell
enthusiast it's completely ntatural. By the way, I think that's
because I was starting on DOS so I remember those times and
hmmmm... Command line interface teach us another approach to
computing. I really appreciate it.
Second what I've learned – attitude to text editing. Most
people treat it so "mechanicaly" — in terms of moving cursor
and text input. Vim encourages thinking in terms of searching
and replacing regex. This makes you more likely to automate
it very much.
Now, after long time, again I'm working again, this time
(thanks god!) with compiled, low level code. So I start
defining it again. I must provide well environment for hex
editing and very close integration with GDB. That's gonna be
awesome.
